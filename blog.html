                <p class="how did it go?">
                    So how did my first Hack4Impact project go? I would say <em>pretty</em> well! There were a few times where I struggled, such as when I was trying to commit to my own personal repository. I think I had such a hard time, because in my CSC 357 class this year my teacher made us create a SSH for GitHub. As a result, when I tried to commit to the repository, it didn't let me, because I wasn't using a key. Other than that, though, everything when smoothly and I had a great time designing this website!
