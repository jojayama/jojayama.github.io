            <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Jodi Yamane</strong>! I'm a second year <strong>Computer Science</strong> major!</p>
            <p>Some fun facts about me are that I'm a cat person, but I love my 2 dogs, Keiko and Buds. I also have 2 cats named Joey and Nala that I also love! I'm looking forward to meeting other computer science majors and those who are interested in computers and systems!</p>
            <p>I have worked with <strong>Java, Python, C,</strong> and <strong>RISC-V</strong>.</p>
